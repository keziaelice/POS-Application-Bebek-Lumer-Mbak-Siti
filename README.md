## POS Application Bebek Lumer Mbak Siti

Ineffective manual recording system, untrackable income and expenses, and difficult-to-manage inventory system. Those are challenges faced by Bebek Lumer Mbak Siti, an MSME in Surabaya operating in the FnB sector. To help them improve their business system, we gathered information regarding their needs and preferences through interviews and workflow observations. Based on that information, we designed an automated system and continued to build a POS Application. 

Notes: 
1. Before running the application, don't forget to import the database from the database.sql file.
2. Use the stored account (_username: Dito Surya_, _password: adminadmin_)
